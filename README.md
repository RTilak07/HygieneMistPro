# HygieneMistPro – Contactless Hand Sanitization System

## Problem Statement
Shared hand sanitizer bottles require physical contact, which can contribute to the spread of germs and infections. There is a need for a simple, low-cost, contactless sanitization solution to improve hygiene and safety.

## Solution
HygieneMistPro is a sensor-based, contactless hand sanitization system that automatically dispenses sanitizer when a hand is detected near the nozzle. It reduces physical contact and helps prevent the spread of germs in public and private spaces.

## Hardware Used
- Arduino board  
- IR sensor  
- DC motor (sanitizer pump)  
- Waste bottle (used as sanitizer container)  
- Connecting wires  
- Power supply  

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE  

## Working Principle
- The IR sensor detects a hand placed near the nozzle  
- The Arduino receives the signal from the sensor  
- The Arduino activates the DC motor  
- The motor sprays sanitizer from the waste bottle  
- After a short delay, the motor automatically turns OFF  

## Project Type
This project is a **working prototype** that successfully performs automatic hand sanitization using sensor-based detection.

## My Contribution
- Designed the project idea and overall working logic  
- Connected and integrated the Arduino, IR sensor, and DC motor  
- Wrote, tested, and debugged the Arduino code  
- Assembled the physical prototype using a waste bottle as the sanitizer container  

## Applications
- Schools and colleges  
- Offices and workplaces  
- Hospitals and clinics  
- Public entry points  

## Future Improvements
- Add rechargeable battery support  
- Improve enclosure design  
- Add adjustable spray timing  
- Integrate IoT monitoring
